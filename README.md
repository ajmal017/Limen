# StockMarketPredictor
## Inspiration
 - To learn about the stock market.
 - To develop an analysis tool that will make stocks be easier to understand.
 - To build a predictor based on news and historical prices.
 - To create a list of safe stocks that are good for investments.

## Timeline (Work in Progress)
 - Finished creating the basis of a wrapper for AlphaVantage API.
 - Build my website on React.
 - Plot stock prices on graphs using plotly.
 - Build a predictor based on these functions from the API.
