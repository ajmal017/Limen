# Limen
## Inspiration
 - To learn about the stock market.
 - To develop an analysis tool that will make stocks be easier to understand.
 - To build a predictor based on news and historical prices.
 - To create a list of safe stocks that are good for investments.

## Timeline (Work in Progress)
 - Finished creating the basis of a wrapper for AlphaVantage API.
 - Created a Batch Handler to process API requests to 5 requests per minute (Free tier)
 - Finished building my Website on React-Redux.
 - Plotted my stock prices and trendline from using polynomial regression on Plotly React.
 - Built a Time Series Predictor from sklearn using polynomial regression of degree 3 (4 or above is overfitting and takes too much time to process.)

## Future Goals
 - Deploy my website online.
 - Automate 3300 companies listed on NASDAQ based on my predictor and generate results whether I should invest on this stock or not.
 - Plan to integrate several technical indicators from AlphaVantage and use them for more machine learning models.

## Apps
  Limen - Contains a list of packages needed to install on the backend.
  Regressor - Builds a polynomial regression on the stock prices.
  Retriever - Retrieves stock prices from AlphaVantage.

## Frontend - Website
  Website - Stores all of the frontend of the React-Redux website.
