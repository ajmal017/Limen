# Limen
## Inspiration
 - To learn about the stock market.
 - To create a stock portfolio for future investments.
 - To develop an analysis tool that will make stocks be easier to understand.
 - To build a predictor based on historical prices.
 - To create a list of safe stocks that are good for investments.

## Timeline (Work in Progress)
 - Finished creating the basis of a wrapper for AlphaVantage API.
 - Created a Batch Handler to process API requests to 5 requests per minute (Free tier)
 - Finished building my Website on React-Redux.
 - Plotted my stock prices and trendline from using polynomial regression on Plotly React.
 - Built a Time Series Predictor from sklearn using polynomial regression of degree 3 (4 or above is overfitting and takes too much time to process.)
 - Used correlation coefficient for my steady score.
 - Calculated the derivative of the trend in the stock prices as my potential growth score.
 - Deployed my Django/React-Redux Application on Heroku.
 - Automated predictions on thousands of companies listed on NASDAQ and NYSE to make my stock portfolio.

## Future Goals
 - Plan to integrate several technical indicators from AlphaVantage and use them for more machine learning models.

## Apps
  Limen - Contains a list of packages needed to install on the backend.
  Regressor - Builds a polynomial regression on the stock prices.
  Retriever - Retrieves stock prices from AlphaVantage.

## Frontend - Website
  Front - Runs on a React/Redux Website.
